# Industrial-Human-Resource-Geo-Visualization

Problem Statement
The workforce distribution across various industrial sectors in India, especially concerning the main and marginal workers (excluding cultivators and agricultural laborers), needs to be analyzed and updated. Current workforce classification is outdated and doesnâ€™t accurately reflect the labor force trends across the country. This project aims to create an up-to-date geo-visualization of industrial human resources by providing a more accurate representation of the workforce distribution by industry, geography, and sex. The goal is to use this data for policy-making, employment planning, and improving industry-related strategies.

2. Tools Used
Data Analysis (EDA):
 Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Data Visualization:
 Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Natural Language Processing (NLP):
 To process and categorize industrial data based on business sectors (e.g., Retail, Manufacturing, Agriculture)
Web Application:
 Streamlit for interactive dashboard
PowerPoint:
 For the final presentation

4. Approaches
Data Preprocessing:

Merge and Clean Data: 
 Combine the provided CSV files containing the workforce data across multiple sectors and states. Ensure consistency, handle missing values, and clean erroneous data.
Data Transformation: 
 Convert data into a format that is easier to analyze (e.g., convert categorical variables to numerical ones, handle outliers).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Perform a thorough analysis to understand trends, correlations, and distributions in the data.
Use statistical methods to identify key factors affecting workforce distribution (e.g., gender, industry, state).
Visualize the data for insights such as the number of male vs. female workers across various industries, regional trends, etc.

Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Text Classification: 
 Use NLP techniques to categorize industries (e.g., Retail, Agriculture, Manufacturing) from business descriptions.
Grouping: 
 Group similar industries together to form broader categories and understand labor distributions better.
Model Building & Testing:

Feature Engineering: 
 Develop new features that might enhance the analysis (e.g., worker density, employment ratio by industry, etc.).
Predictive Modeling (Optional): 
 If applicable, use classification/regression models to predict worker distributions based on past data.

Geo-Visualization:
Use Plotly and Streamlit to create a dashboard that allows interactive exploration of the workforce data across different geographies (states, regions) and industries.
Visualize key metrics like worker populations in different sectors, gender-based distributions, and geographical trends.

Deployment:
 Publish the Streamlit app for interactive use by policy makers, researchers, and businesses.

4. EDA Insights:
Worker Distribution:
 The data will show how the workforce is distributed across different industries and how that distribution varies by state and gender.
Industry Trends:
 Insights into which industries are seeing growth or decline in workforce participation and which states are leading in specific sectors.
Gender Representation:
 Identify how gender is distributed across different industries and regions, and identify areas of imbalance or equality.
Geographical Insights:
 Discover workforce patterns based on geography, highlighting regions with a high concentration of certain industries.
